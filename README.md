# odin-sub-strings

This is a project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-stock-picker).
It implements a stock picker function that takes in an array of stock prices, one for each hypothetical day.
It returns a pair of days representing the best day to buy and the best day to sell.
Days start at 0.
